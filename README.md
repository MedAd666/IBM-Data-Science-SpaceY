# 🚀 SpaceY: Predicting SpaceY Falcon 9 First Stage Landing

## 📋 Project Scenario and Overview

In this project, we dive into the exciting world of commercial space travel! 🌌 Companies like **Virgin Galactic**, **Rocket Lab**, **Blue Origin**, and **SpaceX** are making space travel more accessible. Among these, **SpaceX** stands out with its remarkable achievements:

- 🛰️ Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS).
- 🌍 **Starlink**, a satellite internet constellation providing global internet access.
- 👨‍🚀 Sending manned missions to space.

One key factor behind SpaceX's success is its ability to reduce launch costs. For example, the **Falcon 9 rocket** is advertised at **$62 million per launch**, significantly cheaper than competitors charging upwards of **$165 million**. This cost efficiency is largely due to SpaceX's ability to **reuse the first stage** of the rocket.

🎯 **Our Goal**: Determine if the first stage of the Falcon 9 will land successfully, as this directly impacts the cost of a launch.

## 🛠️ Project Details

### 🚀 Falcon 9 Rocket Overview
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket operates similarly to traditional rockets but with a key difference: **reusability**. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **Payload**: Enclosed in the fairings.
- **Second Stage**: Helps bring the payload to orbit.
- **First Stage**: Does most of the heavy lifting and is much larger than the second stage. This stage is **reusable**, which is a game-changer for cost efficiency.

## 🎯 Capstone Project: SpaceY

In this capstone, we will take on the role of a **Data Scientist** working for **SpaceY**, a new rocket company founded by billionaire industrialist **Allon Musk**. 🧑‍💻 Our mission is to help SpaceY compete with SpaceX by:

1. **Creating dashboards** to visualize key metrics for our team.
2. **Predicting if SpaceX will reuse the first stage** using machine learning.

Instead of relying on rocket science, we'll use **public data** and **machine learning models** to predict the success of the first stage landing.
